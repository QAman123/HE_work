PC cups are sometimes preferred for premium events due to the better look and feel.

    "text": "**Single use cup option**\n\n If reusable cups are not feasible in your market, there are different options for single use plastic cups. \n\nThere are 2 main options: Polypropylene and RPET. Visually and tactile they are very similar, but have a different sustainability characteristic.\n\n**Consideration:**\n\nBoth RPET cups and PP cups have their sustainability advantages and disadvantages, and the better option depends on the specific circumstances of the event. RPET is a type of plastic that is made from recycled PET materials, such as plastic bottles. Using RPET cups can help reduce waste and conserve resources, as they are made from recycled materials and can be recycled into new products. PP cups, on the other hand, are not made from recycled materials, but they are also recyclable. PP cups are also lightweight and have a lower carbon footprint than RPET cups. Not only in production, but also less weight has to be transported.\n\n**To make the right choice:**\n\nTo make the right choice, it is important to consider two key factors. The first is the availability of recycling facilities in your local area. While all plastics are technically recyclable, local recycling plants might not accept all types of plastic. Therefore, you should use the type of plastic cup material that has the highest chance of getting recycled in your market. Check with local municipalities or waste management companies to determine which type of cup is most appropriate. If both RPET and PP cups have the same chance of being recycled, then your decision should be based on your environmental priorities. If reducing CO2 emissions is more important, then you should use PP cups. The exact difference in carbon footprint depends on the cup shape/size and any transport distances. On the other hand, if reducing the use of virgin materials is more important, then you should use RPET cups. By using recycled materials, you can help conserve natural resources and reduce the environmental impact of your event.\n\n **Branding on cups**\n\n Be careful with branding cups for specific events. If a specific event/date is mentioned on a cup, they might not be usable after the event, leading to discarding/writing off the leftover unused cups. Click below to learn more on decoration options",
